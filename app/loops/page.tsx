        Loops are used to repeat instructions how many times you want, the two major types of loops are for and while. For loops often look like this: [for iterator in range(star, stop, step):] An iterator is a variable that is created and can only be used within the loop, it changes every time the loop starts over. The range creates a list of values that the iterator can be while inside the for loop. Start is the starting integer, stop is the ending integer, step is the value the iterator changes by each time the loop restarts. You can also use for loops to be able to iterate through letters in a string. Then, you are able to do whatever you want with the letters in that string. While loops just keep on doing something until the conditions are no longer True. It is very similar to an if statement, and all the conditions and chains can also be used in while loops as in if statements, as it is ust checking for the truthfulness. While loops also contain an else statement which will be run the moment the loop becomes false. While loops are used when you donâ€™t know how many times you want to run it, and a for loop is only when you know how many times you want it to run. NOTE: WHILE LOOPS ONLY CHECK THE CONDITION FIRST AT THE BEGGINING OF EACH ITERATION, NOT CONSTANTLY. There are a few commands that you have access to when creating loops and those include break, where you exit out of a loop, it should nEVER BE USED AS THE ONLY EXIT CONDITION. Continue is used to jump back to the beginning of a loop, pass is to be used temporarily when you are changing code in other areas to make sure your code does not die. While True should just never be used, but it essentially will keep the code running indefinitely until a break.
